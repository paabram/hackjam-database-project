Patrick Aabram - Database project for SHPE USF Hackjam 2023

I went into this hackathon wanting to build something applying the little
bit of SQL knowledge I had been self-teaching. My friends' goals for the
day were to learn Node.js and implement web scraping, so originally we 
were going to combine these and build a recipe database. As the day wore
on while we tried to learn Node, it became clear this project was out of
our scope for the time being, and we separated into individual projects.
This was the fruit of those efforts. This project allows a user to input
their name and age, then sends that information via WebSockets to a 
server running on my computer which stores it in a MySQL database. I am
very pleased with it considering I started with no knowledge of Node 
whatsoever and minimal web development skills. These files are copied
from our (now private) Hackjam repository and just cleaned up a bit to 
be more presentable.

STEPS TO FUNCTION:  
1. Patrick must start MySQL80 in Services on his laptop.
2. Patrick must run server.js with Node on his laptop.
3. The frontend can then be opened from any computer and will function.
